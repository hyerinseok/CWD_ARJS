*So when I first started looking into AR in browsers, I only knew of ARTOOLKIT. Which I used for unity a long long time ago. When I went back to their website(http://www.hitl.washington.edu/artoolkit/) and github(https://github.com/artoolkit/ARToolKit5). I realized they haven't updated their code in a while.
